// The array is empty, so digits[0] is undefined at run time and reading
// .length off it throws. tsc types digits[0] as string and accepts the line,
// which is what lets this case reach vitest at all.
//
// vitest names the exception on a line of its own, and red_amber_green.rb
// reads any name other than AssertionError as something that stopped a test
// rather than a test failing, so a thrown error here is amber, not red.
